These system messages indicate a problem with the supervisor engine. The system detected and fixed a parity error in the hardware. If you see this error repeatedly, there is a strong likelihood of a hardware fault. The issue can be troubleshooted as below:
- Some problems will prevent a console connection and will not allow to use messages in diagnosing a problem.
- Problems with redundant supervisor systems are often due to mismatched active and standby supervisor engines. Redundancy requires that both supervisor engines be the same model, have the same amount of SDRAM memory and running the same Cisco IOS release. If one supervisor has a NetFlow service card, the other must as well.
- Some problems with supervisor engines are due to backplane connections that are not fully seated. If removing and reinserting the supervisor engine and then restarting the switch does not solve the problem, you may need to call Cisco TAC.
- If unable to establish a terminal connection and the STATUS LED is red, contact Cisco TAC immediately to order a replacement.

The reason why port in question is receiving pause frames from the peer because transmit queues of ports on a switching module pool did not drain and queue space was not released. The pool may not map exactly to a slot. If this happened in response to a policy configuration, the new policy does not take effect. If it happened with the insertion of a switching module, the module cannot be used to transmit traffic.

There is no workaround. The conditions for this bug - CSCuf85528 are other diagnostic tests which are failing due to non hardware causes. Two examples of such tests which can fail due to a software condition are TestL3TcamMonitoring and TestScratchRegister. In both of these cases autoboot of the supervisor is disabled. In addition there are no log messages on the console or in the crashinfo file which explain that autoboot was being disabled. For the Sup32 and Sup720 autoboot is disabled by changing the SP configuration register to 0x0. The current value of the SP configuration register can be checked with the command: remote command switch show version command For the Sup2T autoboot is disabled by changing the configuration register to 0x2100.

Troubleshooting Guidelines:
1) Check to see if there is any active maintenance in progress.

Any active maintenance on the chassis may be a factor in causing this issue. If you find that there is maintenance on the chassis, then follow up with the relevant team driving the maintenance. It is possible that the syslog messages are a result of a card reload. 

If you find that there is no maintenance on the chassis, use the following steps to investigate the problem and open a Cisco TAC case.

2) Identify the source of the problem (specific linecard location information) from the syslog message. You should be able to find this after the failed in keyword in the given syslog. In this example it is linecard 0 4. For details on how the output of the commands in this TSG are used, refer to the Health Check Playbook.

To identify the faulty hardware, issue the following commands:

show platform
admin show platform

Linecards that are healthy will have an SW State of OPERATIONAL, and a Config State of NSHUT, as shown below:

0 2 NC55-36X100G OPERATIONAL OPERATIONAL NSHUT

If any fabric cards (shown as FCx x) are down, drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 10.

3) Check the system for active alarms:

show alarms brief system active 

Any alarms not related to this specific linecard indicate a larger issue, drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 8.

4) How many linecards are down? If more than XX cards are down, drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 8.

5) Check the fabric plane health:

admin show controller fabric plane all detail 

Plane Admin Plane up->dn up->mcast
Id State State counter counter
--------------------------------------
0 UP UP 0 0
1 UP UP 0 0
2 UP UP 0 0
3 UP UP 0 0
4 UP UP 0 0
5 UP UP 0 0

Healthy fabric plans with be displayed in the UP state; fabric planes in the MCAST_DOWN, or DOWN state indicate a problem. The system can operate with only one operational (UP UP) fabric plane, however, it will be traffic impacting. If more than one fabric plane has an issue, drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 8. If any of the fabric planes are in the MCAST_DOWN state, monitor them for 15 minutes, if they remain in that state, drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 8.

6) If the affected card is still down and check the restart reason from the reboot-history command below. 

admin show reboot-history card location 0 4

If the there are multiple components rebooting, or a component repeatedly rebooting, this indicates a potentially bigger issue, immediately drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 8.

7) Reload the affected card from admin mode if the card is still down.

hw-module location 0 4 reload

Wait for the card to come up, this may take a few minutes. Repeat step 2 to very the card status.

8) If the card is still down, then collect the following command outputs, related syslog messages and other related outputs to open a Cisco TAC case.

show logging
admin show logging
admin show platform
admin show install active
admin show reboot-history card location 0 4
show tech-support
show context location all
show redundancy
show cli history detail
show config commit list 100
show process blocked location all ( repeat 3 times)
show running
admin show running
admin show inventory
admin show version

9) Shutdown the card by running the following command to shutdown the card from admin mode:

hw-module location 0 4 shutdown

10) Open up a Cisco TAC Case.","Trigger:

"Objective:
Shutdown the system if the problem is seen without any known trigger. Also, check to see if there is or was maintenance on the affected chassis. Isolate the system and open up Cisco TAC case.

Troubleshooting Guidelines:
1) Check to see if there is any active maintenance in progress.

Any active maintenance on the chassis maybe a factor in causing this issue. For instance, if a fabric card is being replaced, the fan trays must be removed. In that case, you have up to 2 minutes to reinert the replacement before the system powers itself off due to excess temperature. If you find that there is maintenance on the chassis, then follow up with the relevant team driving the maintenance. It maybe possible that the syslog messages are a result of an active maintenance window. 

If you find that there is no maintenance on the chassis, then you will need to use the following steps to investigate the problem and open a Cisco TAC case.

2) Identify the source of the problem (specific fan tray location information) from the syslog message:

admin show platform

0 FT0 NC55-5508-FAN OPERATIONAL NA NSHUT 
0 FT1 NC55-5508-FAN OPERATIONAL NA NSHUT 
0 FT2 NC55-5508-FAN OPERATIONAL NA NSHUT 

Fan trays (FT) are should be in the HW OPERATIONAL, and Config NSHUT state. Any fan trays not in this state are faulty.

3) Check the system for active alarms:

show alarms brief system active 

Any alarms not related to this specific linecard indicate a larger issue. Drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 10.

4) Verify that the fan trays are plugged in chassis.

admin show environment fan

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
0 FT2 NC55-5508-FAN 3035 1977 3096 2142 3010 

The number of fan trays in step 2 and 4 should match.

6) Reseat the fan trays using the NCS5500 Replacement MOP process.

7) Repeat step 2 and step 4.

8) If the problem is not resolved, have someone physically swap fantrays with any spare fantray which might be present at the site.

9) Repeat step 2 and step 4.

10) If the problem still is not resoved, then open Cisco TAC case and keep the chassis in shutdown using below:

admin hw-module location all shutdown","Trigger: 
There are no fan trays plugged into the chassis, chassis cooling is non-operational, and chassis ambient temperature and card temperatures may rise to excessive temperature conditions.

This could happen because of an active maintenance window to replace fabric cards or fan trays.

What is possibly Happening now:

"Objective:
Determine the location of the system component. Check to see if there is or was maintenance on the affected chassis linecard. Isolate the affected fabric card, identified in the syslog message and open up Cisco TAC case if the issue is seen without any trigger. 


Troubleshooting Guidelines:
1) Check to see if there is any active maintenance in progress.

Any active maintenance on the chassis maybe a factor in causing this issue. If you find that there is maintenance on the chassis, then follow up with the relevant team driving the maintenance. It maybe possible that the syslog messages are a result of an active maintenance window. 

If you find that there is no maintenance on the chassis, then you will need to use the following steps to investigate the problem and open a Cisco TAC case.

2) Identify the source of the problem (specific fabric card location information) from the syslog message or using below output. For example: 0 FC4. For details on how the output of the commands in this TSG are used, refer to the Health Check Playbook.

To identify the faulty hardware from the following commands:

show platform
admin show platform

Linecards that are healthy will have an SW State of OPERATIONAL, and a Config State of NSHUT, as shown below:

0 FC4 NC55-5516-FC OPERATIONAL OPERATIONAL NSHUT 

Healthy fabric cards should by in the HW SW OPERATIONAL, and Config NSHUT states.

3) Check the system for active alarms:

show alarms brief system active 

Any alarms not related to this specific linecard indicate a larger issue. Drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 7.

4) How many fabric cards are down? If more than one card is down, drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 7.

5) Check the fabric plane health:

Plane Admin Plane up->dn up->mcast
Id State State counter counter
--------------------------------------
0 UP UP 0 0
1 UP UP 0 0
2 UP UP 0 0
3 UP UP 0 0
4 UP UP 0 0
5 UP UP 0 0

Healthy fabric plans with be displayed in the UP state; fabric planes in the MCAST_DOWN, or DOWN state indicate a problem. The system can operate with only one operational (UP UP) fabric plane, however it will be traffic impacting. If more than one fabric plane has an issue, drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 7. If any of the fabric planes are in the MCAST_DOWN state, monitor them for 15 minutes. If they remain in that state, drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 7.

admin show controller fabric plane all detail 
admin show controller fabric health

6) Reload the affected fabric card from admin mode:

hw-module location 0 FC4 reload

Wait for the card to come up; this may take a few minutes. repeat step 2 to verify the card has successfully rebooted.

7) If the problem still exists then collect following CLI command output, and related syslog messages:

show logging
admin show logging
admin show platform
admin show install active
show tech-support
show context location all
show redundancy
show cli history detail
show config commit list 100
show running
admin show running
admin show inventory
admin show version

8) Shutdown the affected fabric card from admin mode. 

hw-module location 0 FC4 shutdown

9) Open up Cisco TAC Case.","Trigger: 
The fabric server encountered an error while initializing the CPU control ASIC to either receive packets from the fabricq ASIC or transmit packets from the ingressq ASIC. This is crucial for the process and is automatically restarted on this failure. 

What is possibly Happening now: 
Fabric server or SFE(switch fabric element) driver process has reported a fault in one of the ASIC during ingress or egress of packet. ASIC has been automatically restarted and may continue to work. This message could be seen during the system bootup or during the fabric card bootup. This error can re-occur if not resolved. A fabric card reload might resolve if the issue is seen again. 

This message is typically seen when a fabric module is being replaced and there are no fan trays plugged into the chassis. Chassis cooling will be non-operational, and chassis ambient temperature and card temperatures may rise to over temperature conditions which can lead to hardware failures.

This error has not been reported in the TAC database as having been seen in the field, and does not exist in the syslog event database. This may be a deprecated error.",N,FABRIC-FAB_SVR-7-ERR_ASIC_INIT,FABRIC-FAB_SVR-7-ERR_ASIC_INIT,*FABRIC-FAB_SVR-7-ERR_ASIC_INIT*Failed to initialize*,2,0,0

This means packets that go that slot of that priority will fail. In addition, at least one of the multicast queues (high or low priority) is blocked as well. This likely means the particular slot is failing to accept packets and will cause backpressure on the PRP to fabric queue. Because of hardware design, if a multicast packet includes the one faulty slot then it will be stuck in the tofab multicast queue, and subsequent multicast packets will be stuck even if they do not include the faulty slot in their slotmask.

"Objective:
Determine if maintenance is currently underway, if not, collect CLI information and open a TAC case.

Troubleshooting Guidelines:
1) Check to see if there is any active maintenance in progress.

Any active maintenance on the chassis maybe a factor in causing this issue. If you find that there is maintenance on the chassis, then follow up with the relevant team driving the maintenance. It maybe possible that the syslog messages are a result of a card reload, or unrelated maintenance event.

If you find that there is no maintenance on the chassis, then you will need to use the following steps to investigate the problem and open a Cisco TAC case.

2) Drain traffic from the device using the <drain traffic process> 

3) If that fails to fix the problem, collect the following CLI:

show logging
admin show logging
admin show platform
admin show install active
admin show reboot-history card location 0 4
show tech-support
show context location all
show cli history detail
show config commit list 100
show process blocked location all ( repeat 3 times)
show running
admin show running
admin show inventory
admin show version

"Objective:
Determine if maintenance is currently underway, if not, collect CLI information and open a TAC case.

Troubleshooting Guidelines:
1) Check to see if there is any active maintenance in progress.

Any active maintenance on the chassis maybe a factor in causing this issue. If you find that there is maintenance on the chassis, then follow up with the relevant team driving the maintenance. It maybe possible that the syslog messages are a result of an active maintenance window. 

If you find that there is no maintenance on the chassis, then you will need to use the following steps to investigate the problem and open a Cisco TAC case.

2) Identify the source of the problem (specific fabric card location information) from card number after the DOWN at keyword in the syslog message. For example: 0 FC5. For details on how the output of the commands in this TSG are used, refer to the Health Check Playbook.

To identify the faulty hardware from the following commands:

show platform
admin show platform

Linecards that are healthy will have an SW State of OPERATIONAL, and a Config State of NSHUT, as shown below:

0 FC5 NC55-5516-FC OPERATIONAL OPERATIONAL NSHUT 

Healthy fabric cards should by in the HW SW OPERATIONAL, and Config NSHUT states.

3) Check the system for active alarms:

show alarms brief system active 

Any alarms not related to this specific linecard indicate a larger issue. Drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 7.

4) How many fabric cards are down? If more than one card is down, drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 7.

5) Check the fabric plane health:

Healthy fabric plans with be displayed in the UP state; fabric planes in the MCAST_DOWN, or DOWN state indicate a problem. The system can operate with only one operational (UP UP) fabric plane, however it will be traffic impacting. If more than one fabric plane has an issue, drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 7. If any of the fabric planes are in the MCAST_DOWN state, monitor them for 15 minutes. If they remain in that state, drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 7.

"Objective:
Verify that the card is still having an issue. Check to see if there are any other issues. Collect diagnostic information, and try to reload the fabric card.

Troubleshooting Guidelines:
1) Check to see if there is any active maintenance in progress.

Any active maintenance on the chassis maybe a factor in causing this issue. If you find that there is maintenance on the chassis, then follow up with the relevant team driving the maintenance. It maybe possible that the syslog messages are a result of a card reload, or unrelated maintenance event.

If you find that there is no maintenance on the chassis, then you will need to use the following steps to investigate the problem and open a Cisco TAC case.

2) Identify the source of the problem (specific linecard location information) from the syslog message. You should be able to find this after the R S I: keyword in the given syslog. In this example it is 0 FC3. For details on how the output of the commands in this TSG are used, refer to the Health Check Playbook.

To identify the faulty hardware from the following commands:

show platform
admin show platform

Heathly fabric cards will have an SW State of OPERATIONAL, and a Config State of NSHUT, as shown below:

0 FC3 NC55-5516-FC OPERATIONAL OPERATIONAL NSHUT 

If any other fabric cards are down, there is a more serious issue. Drain traffic from the chassis using the <insert drain traffic link> process, and skip to step 7.

3) Check the system for active alarms:

show alarms brief system active 

Any alarms not related to this specific fabric card indicate a larger issue. Drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link> and proceed to step 7.

4) Check the fabric plane health:

admin show controller fabric plane all detail 

Plane Admin Plane up->dn up->mcast
Id State State counter counter
--------------------------------------
0 UP UP 0 0
1 UP UP 0 0
2 UP UP 0 0
3 UP UP 0 0
4 UP UP 0 0
5 UP UP 0 0

Healthy fabric plans with be displayed in the UP state; fabric planes in the MCAST_DOWN, or DOWN state indicate a problem. The system can operate with only one operational (UP UP) fabric plane, however it will be traffic impacting. If more than one fabric plane has an issue, drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 7. If any of the fabric planes are in the MCAST_DOWN state, monitor them for 15 minutes. If they remain in that state, drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 7.

5) If the card is still down, collect the following CLI:

show tech fabric
admin show tech fabric
show tech

Reload the affected card using the following admin mode command:

hw-module location 0 FC3 reload

Wait for the card to come up. This can take a few minutes. Repeat step 2 to verify card operation.

6) If the card is stil down, reseat the affected card, and wait for the card to come up. Refer to the NCS5500 Replacement MOP for more information on how to reseat a particular system component. 

Wait for the card to come up. This can take a few minutes. Repeat step 2 to verify card operation.

7) If the card is still not online then collect the following command outputs, related syslog messages and other related outputs:

show logging
admin show logging
admin show platform
admin show install active
admin show reboot-history card location 0 FC3
admin show controller card-mgr event-history detail location 0 FC3

None required,"A protocol (UDP, TCP, or ICMP) failed to create a translation through the firewall. The firewall provides this checking for addresses that are explicitly identified with static command statements. With the change, for inbound traffic, the firewall denies translations for a destined IP address identified as a network or broadcast address.

The firewall does not apply PAT to all ICMP message types; it only applies PAT ICMP echo and echo-reply packets (types 8 and 0). Specifically, only ICMP echo or echo-reply packets create a PAT xlate. So, when the other ICMP messages types are dropped, this message is generated.

The firewall uses the global IP and mask from configured static command statements to differentiate regular IP addresses from network or broadcast IP addresses. If the global IP address is a valid network address with a matching network mask, the firewall does not create a translation for network or broadcast IP addresses with inbound packets.

For example:

static (inside,outside) 10.2.2.128 10.1.1.128 netmask 255.255.255.128

Global address 10.2.2.128 is responded to as a network address and 10.2.2.255 is responded to as the broadcast address. Without an existing translation, the firewall denies inbound packets destined for 10.2.2.128 or 10.2.2.255, and generates this syslog message.

When the suspected IP is a host IP, configure a separated static command statement with a host mask in front of the subnet static (first match rule for static command statements). The following static command statements cause the firewall to respond to 10.2.2.128 as a host address:

static (inside,outside) 10.2.2.128 10.2.2.128 netmask 255.255.255.255 
static (inside,outside) 10.2.2.128 10.2.2.128 netmask 255.255.255.128

The translation may be created by traffic started with the inside host with the questioned IP address. Because the firewall views a network or broadcast IP address as a host IP address with overlapped subnet static configuration, the network address translation for both static command statements must be the same.

Determine the location of the system component (linecard or fabric card). 

Check to see if there is or was maintenance being performed on the affected chassis linecard. 

Isolate the card, identified in the syslog message and open up Cisco TAC case.

Troubleshooting Guidelines:
1) Check to see if there is any active maintenance in progress.

Any active maintenance on the chassis maybe a factor in causing this issue. If you find that there is maintenance on the chassis, then follow up with the relevant team driving the maintenance. It maybe possible that the syslog messages are a result of a card reload, or unrelated maintenance event.

If you find that there is no maintenance on the chassis, then you will need to use the following steps to investigate the problem and open a Cisco TAC case.

2) Verify the no shutdown command was issued by issuing the following command:
 
show cli history detail

If the no shutdown command was issued, this is an informational message and no action is needed.

3) Identify the source of the problem (specific linecard location information) from the syslog message. You should be able to find this at the beginning of the given syslog message. In this example it is linecard 0 6. For details on how the output of the commands in this TSG are used, refer to the Health Check Playbook.

"Objective:
Determine the location of the system component (linecard or fabric card). Check to see if there is, or was maintenance being performed on the affected chassis linecard. Isolate the card, identified in the syslog message and open up Cisco TAC case if the issue occurred without any trigger. 

Troubleshooting Guidelines:
1) Check to see if there is any active maintenance in progress.

Any active maintenance on the chassis maybe a factor in causing this issue. If you find that there is maintenance on the chassis, then follow up with the relevant team driving the maintenance. It maybe possible that the syslog messages are a result of a card reload, or unrelated maintenance event.

If you find that there is no maintenance on the chassis, then you will need to use the following steps to investigate the problem and open a Cisco TAC case.

2) Identify the source of the problem (specific linecard location information) from the syslog message. You should be able to find this after the for card keyword in the given syslog. In this example it is linecard 0 5. For details on how the output of the commands in this TSG are used, refer to the Health Check Playbook.

To identify the faulty hardware from the following commands:

3) Check the system for active alarms:

show alarms brief system active 

Any alarms not related to this specific linecard indicate a larger issue. Drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link> and proceed to step 6.

4) How many linecards are down? If more than XX cards are down. Drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link> and proceed to step 6.

Healthy fabric plans with be displayed in the UP state; fabric planes in the MCAST_DOWN, or DOWN state indicate a problem. The system can operate with only one operational (UP UP) fabric plane, however it will be traffic impacting. If more than one fabric plane has an issue, drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 6. If any of the fabric planes are in the MCAST_DOWN state, monitor them for 15 minutes. If they remain in that state, drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 6.

3) Check to see if the affected card is still down, and check the restart reason from the reboot-history command. If the card has repeatedly reset for the same reason, skip to step 6.

admin show reboot-history card location 0 5

4) If the card is still down, reload the affected card using the following admin mode command:

hw-module location 0 5 reload

Wait for the card to come up. This can take a few minutes. Repeat step 2 to verify card operation.

5) If the card is stil down, reseat the affected card, and wait for the card to come up. Refer to the NCS5500 Replacement MOP for more information on how to reseat a particular system component. 

Wait for the card to come up. This can take a few minutes. Repeat step 2 to verify card operation.

6) If the card is still not online then collect the following command outputs, related syslog messages and other related outputs:

Determine files that can be removed from var log in order to bring the usage below the 80% threshold.

Troubleshooting Guidelines:
1) Check to see if there is any active maintenance in progress.

Any active maintenance on the chassis maybe a factor in causing this issue. If you find that there is maintenance on the chassis, then follow up with the relevant team driving the maintenance. It maybe possible that the syslog messages are a result of a card reload, or unrelated maintenance event.

If you find that there is no maintenance on the chassis, then you will need to use the following steps to investigate the problem:

2) Check system health. For details on how the output of the commands in this TSG are used, refer to the Health Check Playbook.

show platform
admin show platform

Fabric or linecards that are healthy will have an SW State of OPERATIONAL, and a Config State of NSHUT, as shown below:

0 5 NC55-36X100G OPERATIONAL OPERATIONAL NSHUT

If any fabric cards (shown as FCx x) are down, there is a more serious issue. Drain traffic from the chassis using the <insert drain traffic link> process, and skip to step 5.

3) Check the system for active alarms:

show alarms brief system active 

Any alarms not related to this specific linecard indicate a larger issue. Drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link> and proceed to step 5.

3) Check media usage by issuing the following command:

admin show media

The output will look similar to:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Partition Size Used Percent Avail
---------------------------------------------------------------------
rootfs: 2.4G 913M 41% 1.4G
install: 7.4G 1.8G 25% 5.3G

install: tmp 7.4G 1.8G 25% 5.3G
install: cache 7.4G 1.8G 25% 5.3G
rootfs: install tmp 7.4G 1.8G 25% 5.3G
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The Percent column show the percentage used.

3)From Admin mode verify the file system usage by issuing the following command

run df -k

This will result in a output similar to:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
sysadmin-vm:0_RP0# run df -k
Thu Feb 15 14:52:20.419 UTC

4) From Admin mode display the contents of the var log directory by issuing the following command:

run ls -lrt var log

This will result in an ouptut similar to: (abbriveated output)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
sysadmin-vm:0_RP0# run ls -lhrt var log
Thu Feb 15 15:01:56.673 UTC

-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Jan 26 15:39 mail.info

From this listing you can identify large files that can be removed.

5) From Admin mode, you can remove a file issue the following command:

run rm <file name>

6) If you are unsure about removing files from this directory, collect the following CLI output:

From Admin Mode
run df -k
run ls -lhrt var log

7) Open a Cisco TAC case.

"Objective:
Determine if the NTP server is reachable. Check to see if there is was maintenance going on with either the time server or the device. Open a TAC case if the issue persists. 

Troubleshooting Guidelines:
1) Check to see if there is any active maintenance in progress.

Any active maintenance on the chassis maybe a factor in causing this issue. If you find that there is maintenance on the chassis, then follow up with the relevant team driving the maintenance. It maybe possible that the syslog messages are a result of a card reload, or unrelated maintenance event.

If you find that there is no maintenance on the chassis, then you will need to use the following steps to investigate the problem and open a Cisco TAC case.

2) Check the overall system health. For details on how the output of the commands in this TSG are used, refer to the Health Check Playbook.

To identify the faulty hardware from the following commands:

show platform
admin show platform

Fabric or linecards that are healthy will have an SW State of OPERATIONAL, and a Config State of NSHUT, as shown below:

0 3 NC55-36X100G OPERATIONAL OPERATIONAL NSHUT

If any fabric cards (shown as FCx x) are down, there is a more serious issue. Drain traffic from the chassis using the <insert drain traffic link> process, and skip to step 5.

3) Check the system for active alarms:

show alarms brief system active 

Any alarms not related to this specific linecard indicate a larger issue. Drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link> and proceed to step 5.

4) Verify NTP server reachability by issuing the following commands:

ping ipv4 <NTP ip address> vrf MANAGEMENT
 
If the NTP server replies to the ping request, the clocks are not synchronized between the NTP server and the device. The NTP process will need to be restarted. You can restart the NTP process by issuing the following commands:

show process | include ntp

The output will be something like below:

207 4954 0K 20 Sleeping ntpd 0
207 5058 0K 20 Sleeping ntpd 0
207 5286 0K 20 Sleeping ntpd 0

If any fabric cards (shown as FCx x) are down, there is a more serious issue. Drain traffic from the chassis using the <insert drain traffic link> process, and skip to step 8.

3) Check the system for active alarms:

show alarms brief system active 

Any alarms not related to this specific linecard indicate a larger issue. Drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link> and proceed to step 8.

4) Check the NTP association status using the following command:

show ntp associations

 * sys_peer, # selected, + candidate, - outlayer, x falseticker, ~ configured

The astric and tilde symbols on the left indicate that the NTP session is active and configured. If there is no server with an astric symbol, then there may be an NTP reachablility issue. If there are no NTP servers at all, there is an NTP configuration problem--skip to step 8 to collect data to open a Cisco TAC case.

5) Verify NTP status using the following command:

show ntp status 
Clock is synchronized, stratum 3, reference is 10.1.46.1
nominal freq is 1000000000.0000 Hz, actual freq is -35347479.0752 Hz, precision is 2**24

clock offset is 56.389 msec, root delay is 27.732 msec
root dispersion is 258.22 msec, peer dispersion is 10.97 msec
loopfilter state is CTRL (Normal Controlled Loop), drift is -0.0000292906 s s
system poll interval is 256, last update was 521 sec ago

A health NTP connection should be synchronized with the same reference clock IP as seen in step 4. 

6) Verify NTP server reachability by issuing the following commands
 ping ipv4 <NTP Server IP address> vrf MANAGEMENT
 
If the NTP server replies to the ping request, the clocks are not synchronized between the NTP server and the device. The NTP process will need to be restarted. You can restart the NTP process by issuing the following commands:

show process | include ntp

The output will be something like below:
207 4954 0K 20 Sleeping ntpd 0

"Objective:
Determine if the NTP server is reachable. Check to see if there is was maintenance going on with either the time server or the device. If the issue persists, open a TAC case.

Troubleshooting Guidelines:
1) Check to see if there is any active maintenance in progress.

Any active maintenance on the chassis maybe a factor in causing this issue. If you find that there is maintenance on the chassis, then follow up with the relevant team driving the maintenance. It maybe possible that the syslog messages are a result of a card reload, or unrelated maintenance event.

If you find that there is no maintenance on the chassis, then you will need to use the following steps to investigate the problem and open a Cisco TAC case.

2) Check system health. For details on how the output of the commands in this TSG are used, refer to the Health Check Playbook.

show platform
admin show platform

Fabric or linecards that are healthy will have an SW State of OPERATIONAL, and a Config State of NSHUT, as shown below:

0 5 NC55-36X100G OPERATIONAL OPERATIONAL NSHUT

If any fabric cards (shown as FCx x) are down, there is a more serious issue. Drain traffic from the chassis using the <insert drain traffic link> process, and skip to step 5.

3) Check the system for active alarms:

show alarms brief system active 

Any alarms not related to this specific linecard indicate a larger issue. Drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link> and proceed to step 5.

4) Verify NTP server reachability by issuing the following commands
 ping ipv4 <NTP ip address> vrf MANAGEMENT
 
If the NTP server replies to the ping request, the clocks are not synchronized between the NTP server and the device. The NTP process will need to be restarted, by issuing the following commands:

 show process | include ntp

The output will be something like below:
207 4954 0K 20 Sleeping ntpd 0
207 5058 0K 20 Sleeping ntpd 0
207 5286 0K 20 Sleeping ntpd 0

207 5785 0K 20 Sleeping ntpd 0
207 5811 0K 20 Sleeping ntpd 0
 
The process id is the first column, bold here for readability. Once you know the process id for NTP (207 in this case), you can restart it with the following command:

process restart 207

5) If the issue persists, collect the following output:

"Objective:
Determine the interface generating the message. Make a minor change to the settings of the interface experiencing the problem. This will trigger another attempt to send an update or will correct the problem.

Troubleshooting Guidelines:
1) Check to see if there is any active maintenance in progress.

Any active maintenance on the chassis may be a factor in causing this issue. If you find that there is maintenance on the chassis, then follow up with the relevant team driving the maintenance. 

If you find that there is no maintenance on the chassis, use the following steps to investigate the problem and, if necessary, open a Cisco TAC case.

2) Use the log information to determinte the number of interfaces affected. If multiple interfaces are impacted, this indicates a potentially bigger issue. Immediately drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 7.

3) Identify the source of the problem (the specific interface information) from the syslog message. For example: HundredGigE0 1 0 11 is the interface in the sample syslog message.

4) Drain the traffic from the linecard to which this interface belongs <insert drain traffic link>.

5) Reset the affected interface:

config
interface hu0 1 0 11 shutdown
interface hu0 1 0 11 no shutdown
commit

This should clear the issue. 

6) Resume traffic on the affected line card by reversing step 4.

7) If the issue is not resolved, collect output of the following commands:

show interface hu0 1 0 11
show interface status
show platform
show inventory
show version
show bundle 
show controllers hu0 1 0 11
show logging

8) Open a Cisco TAC case.","Trigger: 
The bundle interface has exceeded the threshold for the number of retries. After attempting to resend or query information a number of times for a set of objects, the retry threshold has been exceeded and no more attempts will be made for any in this set. The effect of the message will therefore be lost. The impact will depend on the message which was lost, but the error will give an indication as to the failure.

"Objective:
Determine the bundle interface impacted and member interface that is causing the issue. Isolate the interface or line card, identified in the syslog message and open up Cisco TAC case if necessary. 

Troubleshooting Guidelines:
1) Check to see if there is any active maintenance in progress.

Any active maintenance on the chassis may be a factor in causing this issue. If you find that there is maintenance on the chassis, then follow up with the relevant team driving the maintenance. 

If you find that there is no maintenance on the chassis, use the following steps to investigate the problem and, if necessary, open a Cisco TAC case.

2) Identify the source of the problem (specific bundle-interface & interface information) from the syslog message. For example: Bundle-Ether1076 & Hu0 2 0 3 are specified in the sample syslog message.

3) Check the log to determine if the interface has been flapping. If the interface has been flapping, shut it down. Use the show log command to view the log, an interface flap is shown as an interface repeatedly going up and then down, for example:

RP 0 RP0 CPU0:Feb 1 17:32:31.365 : ifmgr[137]: %PKT_INFRA-LINK-3-UPDOWN : Interface Bundle-Ether131, changed state to Down 
RP 0 RP0 CPU0:Feb 1 17:32:31.367 : ifmgr[137]: %PKT_INFRA-LINK-3-UPDOWN : Interface Bundle-Ether131, changed state to Up

The utility command can be used to see the last x messages, for example:

show log | utility tail count 5

This example shows the last 5 messages logged.

4) If the entire bundle is flapping, shut the bundle down and proceed to step 10.

config
interface bundle-ether1076 shutdown
commit

5) If only one interface is flapping, administratively shutdown the interface using the interface shutdown command.

config
interface hu0 2 0 3 shutdown
commit

6) If shutting down the interface does not stop the flapping, then shutdown the entire bundle by repeating step 4.

7) Check for any configuration changes that have recently been committed during the time of interface flap.

show cli history detail
show config commit list 100

The time and user login ID of the user can be found in the the CLI history log, as shown below:

show cli history detail | in Jun 12
Sun Jun 12 17:47:49.969 UTC
 1 loginid vty1 exec Sun Jun 12 00:34:14.828 2016 UTC show alarms 
 2 loginid vty1 exec Sun Jun 12 00:34:17.781 2016 UTC show platform 

8) Check the bundle interface status. A healthy interface will be in the Active state, an interface that is down will be in the Down state, as shown below:

show bundle bundle-ether 1076

Bundle-Ether1076
 Status: Down

9) Check for any possible causes of interface or bundle flap . For details on the use of the show controllers command, refer to the Health Check Playbook.

- Check tx rx power levels using show controllers Hu0 2 0 3 
- Check whether optics are properly seated on the linecard 2.
- Check linecard status.
etc.

10) If step 5 does not resolve the problem, then collect the follwoing information:

show interface hu0 2 0 3
show interface status
show platform
show inventory
show version
show bundle bundle-ether 1076
show controllers hu0 2 0 3
show logging

"Objective:
Determine the location of the system component (fabric or linecard). Check to see if there is or was maintenance being performed on the affected chassis linecard. Isolate the card, identified in the syslog message and open up Cisco TAC case if the issue occurred without any trigger. 

Troubleshooting Guidelines:
1) Check to see if there is any active maintenance in progress.

Any active maintenance on the chassis maybe a factor in causing this issue. If you find that there is maintenance on the chassis, then follow up with the relevant team driving the maintenance. It maybe possible that the syslog messages are a result of a card reload. 

If you find that there is no maintenance on the chassis, then you will need to investigate and open a TAC case.

2) To identify the faulty hardware from the following commands:

show platform
admin show platform

Linecards that are healthy will have an SW State of OPERATIONAL, and a Config State of NSHUT, as shown below:

0 2 NC55-36X100G OPERATIONAL OPERATIONAL NSHUT

If any fabric cards (shown as FCx x) are down, drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 9.

3) Check the system for active alarms:

show alarms brief system active 

Any alarms not related to this specific linecard indicate a larger issue. Drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 9.

4) Are any fabric cards down? If more than one fabric card is down, drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 9. If a linecard is down, how many linecards are down? If more than XX cards are down, drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 9.

5) Check the fabric plane health:

admin show controller fabric plane all detail 

Plane Admin Plane up->dn up->mcast
Id State State counter counter
--------------------------------------
0 UP UP 0 0
1 UP UP 0 0
2 UP UP 0 0
3 UP UP 0 0
4 UP UP 0 0
5 UP UP 0 0

Healthy fabric plans with be displayed in the UP state; fabric planes in the MCAST_DOWN, or DOWN state indicate a problem. The system can operate with only one operational (UP UP) fabric plane, however it will be traffic impacting. If more than one fabric plane has an issue, drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 9. If any of the fabric planes are in the MCAST_DOWN state, monitor them for 15 minutes. If they remain in that state, drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 9.

6) Check the fabric health:

 +------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

All fan card (FC) statuses should be in the OK state. If more than one fabric card has an issue, drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 9.

7) Verify if the affected card is still down and check the restart reason from the reboot-history command below. 

admin show reboot-history card location 0 4

If the there are multiple components rebooting, or a component repeatedly rebooting, this indicates a potentially bigger issue. Immediately drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 9.

8) Reload the affected card from admin mode if the card is still down.

hw-module location 0 4 reload

Wait for the card to come up. Use step 2 to check the fabric card status.

9) If the parity error messages are still shown then collect the following command outputs, related syslog messages and other related outputs.

show logging

admin show platform
admin show install active
show tech-support
show context location all
show redundancy
show cli history detail
show config commit list 100

A parity error is observed by the FPGA. A parity error is a bit flip in memory. In electronics and computing, electrical or magnetic interference from internal or external sources can cause a single bit or memory to spontaneously flip to the opposite state. This event makes the original data bits invalid and is known as a parity error. Although these errors are rare in nature but this can be seen in an active system component and a reload of that component clears the issue. The syslog might be seen during device reload or new card bootup.

To resolve this issue, perform these steps:

1. Locate the device sending the reserved destination address packets by using a packet capture tool (like a sniffer) and filter Interior Gateway Management Protocol (IGMP) messages. 

2. Copy packets from a source port to a destination port, where you then attach the sniffer. This is done by using the Switched Port Analyzer (SPAN) feature. 

3. For more information on the SPAN feature, refer to Configuring the Catalyst Switched Port Analyzer (SPAN)(https: www.cisco.com c en us support docs switches catalyst-6500-series-switches 10570-41.html) Feature.
 
4. If you are not using the IGMP feature, you can set IGMP to disable. This is done by issuing the set igmp disable. This stops the error message. 

5. Set the logging level for multicast by issuing the set logging level mcast 2 default. This also stops the message. Otherwise suppressing the message does not resolve the underlying issue","

The messages you are receiving are informational only and are generated when the switch receives IGMP report packets with a multicast MAC address that starts with 01-00-5e-00-00-xx.

This Layer 2 range of addresses is equivalent to a Layer 3 multicast address range between 224.0.0.0 and 224.0.0.255.

These addresses are reserved for the use of routing protocols and other low-level topology discovery or maintenance protocols, such as gateway discovery and group membership reporting. 

So, since these are addresses from a private range , sniff the Interface <Port Number> out the traffic and find out what device is originating the frames.

This does not mean anything is wrong with the switch, these packets floating around from a rogue PC or server.

You can set a span session to capture traffic on port <Port Number> and look for the packet with mac address 01-00-5e-00-00-fb

In order to suppress these error messages from appearing in logs, we can use the below command in catos.

"Objective:
The errors occur when a process, or processes, are busy and could not send a server stats update to Status Serverd before a timeout occured.

Troubleshooting Guidelines:
1) Check to see if maintence is taking place; this issue is seen when a new card is reloading. If a new card has reloaded, monitor the system for 15 minutes to see if any further issues arise.

2) If you find that there is no maintenance on the chassis, then you will need to drain traffic from the system <insert drain traffic link>, and collect the following CLI output:

show log
show platform detail
show install active
show version
show cli history detail
show reboot history 
admin show controller fabric health
show interface brief
show tech snmp
admin show tech control-ethernet

3) Open a Cisco TAC case.","Trigger:

"Objective:
Check to see if maintenace is underway. If not, continue to monitor for 15 minutes, and if the problem persists, collect diagnostic interface and open a Cisco TAC case.

Troubleshooting Guidelines:
1) Check to see if there is any active maintenance in progress.

Any active maintenance on the chassis maybe a factor in causing this issue. If you find that there is maintenance on the chassis, then follow up with the relevant team driving the maintenance. It maybe possible that the syslog messages are a result of a card reload, or unrelated maintenance event.

If you find that there is no maintenance on the chassis, then you will need to use the following steps to investigate the problem and open a Cisco TAC case.

2) Check the overall system health. For details on how the output of the commands in this TSG are used, refer to the Health Check Playbook.

To identify the faulty hardware from the following commands:

show platform
admin show platform

Fabric or linecards that are healthy will have an SW State of OPERATIONAL, and a Config State of NSHUT, as shown below:

0 3 NC55-36X100G OPERATIONAL OPERATIONAL NSHUT

If any fabric cards (shown as FCx x) are down, there is a more serious issue. Drain traffic from the chassis using the <insert drain traffic link> process, and skip to step 4.

3) Check the system for active alarms:

show alarms brief system active 

Any alarms not related to this specific linecard indicate a larger issue. Drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link> and proceed to step 4.

4) Monitor for 15 mins. If syslog appears again then open case with following output:

show version 
show install active summary
show run
admin show platform
show hw-module fpd location all
show log
show process blocked
show cli history detail
show tech

5) Open a Cisco TAC case.",The TTY process failed to set a group ID. This is an informational message. This is a nonservice-impacting syslog message. The explanation is that TTY is using a QNX system call to set the foreground process group id associated with the terminal to process group ID of the calling process.

"Objective:
Determine the location of the system component (power module). 

Check to see if there is or was maintenance being performed on the affected chassis power module. 

Isolate the power module, identified in the syslog message. 

If this issue occured outside of an active maintenance window, open up Cisco TAC case.

Troubleshooting Guidelines:
1) Check to see if there is any active maintenance in progress.

Any active maintenance on the chassis maybe a factor in causing this issue. If you find that there is maintenance on the chassis, then follow up with the relevant team driving the maintenance. It maybe possible that the syslog messages are a result of a card reload, or unrelated maintenance event.

If you find that there is no maintenance on the chassis, then you will need to use the following steps to investigate the problem and open a Cisco TAC case.

2) Identify the source of the problem (specific power supply location information) from the syslog message. You should be able to find this after the DECLARE keyword in the given syslog--in this example it is 0 PM9.

To identify the fault hardware from the following commands:

show platform
admin show platform
admin show inventory power
admin show environment power

 0 PT1-PM0 3kW-AC 205.6 2.5 55.1 7.9 OK 

All LEDs should show the color as GREEN.

To identify the fault hardware from the following commands:

admin show led location 0 PM1

=============================================================
Location LED Name Mode Color
=============================================================
0 PM9
 0 PM9-Fail WORKING OFF
 0 PM9-OK WORKING GREEN

All OK LEDs should show the color as GREEN, and all Fail LED should be OFF. When a PM OK LED is not green, or the Fail LED is on, you will need to physically inspect the power module. 

4) If the power supply is still offline collect the following command outputs, related syslog messages and other related outputs:

 
 show logging
 admin show inventory power
 admin show logging
 admin show platform
 admin show install active
 show tech-support
 admin show inventory
 admin show version

 0 PT1-PM0 3kW-AC 205.6 2.5 55.1 7.9 OK 

Healthy power supplies will have a Status of OK.

5) Determine LED status by issuing the following commands:

admin show led location 0 PM1

Some reasons for connecting individual switches in a power stack are:

1. In case of power supply failure, if there is enough spare power budget in the rest of the power stack, switches can continue to function.
2. You can replace a defective power supply without having to shut down all powered devices in the systems.
3. System operation can become more green by maximizing power supply efficiency and working with the most efficient load (30 to 90% of their maximum load).

Cisco Stack Power uses these terms:

1. Available power is the total power available for PoE from all power supplies in the power stack. 2. To see the available power in a stack, enter the show power inline privileged EXEC command.
3. Budgeted power is the power allocated to all powered devices connected to PoE ports in the stack. 4. Budgeted power is referred to as Used (Watts) in the output of the show power inline command.

Consumed power is the actual power consumed by the powered devices. Consumed power is typically less that the budgeted power. To see the consumed power in a stack, enter the show power inline police privileged EXEC command.

"Objective:
Determine the cause of LEM LPM table exhaustion in the affected linecard. Check to see if there is or was maintenance being performed on the affected chassis linecard. Isolate the device and open up Cisco TAC case if the issue couldn t be root caused. 

This error has not been reported in the TAC database as having been seen in the field, and does not exist in the syslog event database. This may be a deprecated error. 

Troubleshooting Guidelines:
1) Check to see if there is any active maintenance in progress.

Any active maintenance on the chassis maybe a factor in causing this issue. If you find that there is maintenance on the chassis, then follow up with the relevant team driving the maintenance. It is possible that the syslog messages are a result of a card reload. 

If you find that there is no maintenance on the chassis, then you will need to use the following steps to investigate the problem and open a Cisco TAC case.

2) Identify the source of the problem (specific linecard location information) from the syslog message. You should be able to find this after the failed in keyword in the given syslog. In this example it is linecard 0 0. For details on how the output of the commands in this TSG are used, refer to the Health Check Playbook.

To identify the faulty hardware from the following commands:

show platform
admin show platform

Linecards that are healthy will have an SW State of OPERATIONAL, and a Config State of NSHUT, as shown below:

0 2 NC55-36X100G OPERATIONAL OPERATIONAL NSHUT

If any fabric cards (shown as FCx x) are down, drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 7.

3) Compare routing and ARP ND tables with those of other devices in the same role to identify cause of LPM or LEM table exhaustion (either due to a large number of ARP ND entries or a large number of routes). 

RP 0 RP0 CPU0:NCS5508-T3-1#show arp | utility wc
 77 442 5718

Compare the word counts between the devices; save the comparison for the TAC case.

4) Check the network processor (NPU) resources:

show controller npu resources all location 0 0 CPU0

HW Resource Information

Look at LEM, LPM, EEDB tables for OOR State. Compare the out of range (OOR) information with the current useage information to find the source of the problem.

5) Look for possible misconfiguration (e.g. incorrect route filtering or summarization, hosts generating large number of ARP ND entries). This requires knowledge of BGP and ARP protocols and the ability to use the commands for diagnosis. For one-on-one help, drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 7.

8) Open up Cisco TAC Case.","Either the Longest Prefix Match Database (LPM) or Large Exact Match Database (LEM) table for IPv4 and IPv6 routes has crossed the red (95%) threshold--meaning linecard capacity to program the prefixes in the hardware has crossed 95%.

LEM or LPM tables which hold the IPv4 6 routes have crossed 95% threshold. Each Forwarding ASIC (FA) in NCS5500 contains two cores (0 and 1). Each FA has an ingress and egress pipeline. Each pipeline itself is made of different blocks. Along these pipelines, different blocks can access (read write) different databases tables. Separate memory entities are used to store specific types of information, as follows:

• The Longest Prefix Match Database (LPM)—sometimes referred to as KBP Assisted Prefix Search (KAPS) or Knowledge Based Processor (KBP)—is SRAM used to store IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes. It’s an algorithmic memory that can store up to 256k IPv4 entries and 128k IPv6 entries. 
• The Large Exact Match Database (LEM) is also used to store IPv4 and IPv6 routes, MAC addresses, and MPLS labels—it scales to 786k entries.
• The internal TCAM (iTCAM) is used for packet classification (ACL, QoS), and can store 48k entries.
• The FEC database is used to store next-hop (128k entries), containing also the FEC ECMP (4k entries).

Depending on the IPv4 or IPv6 address, family and the prefix-length routes will be sorted and stored in LEM, LPM or eTCAM. Route handling depends on the platform type, the IOS XR release running and the profile activated. The  show controller npu resources all location R S M  command shows the current usage of TCAM resources for the linecard with the maximum entry limitations, and the associated thresholds, and states.

Any further addition of routes beyond 100% would not be accepted for forwarding and packets will be dropped. 

This issue could happen for any of the following reasons:
1) Software issue;
2) Stale entries;
3) Misconfiguration;
4) Incorrect route-filtering or summarization.",N,PLATFORM-DPA-1-OOR_RED,PLATFORM-DPA-1-OOR_RED,*PLATFORM-DPA-1-OOR_RED*,2,0,0
"Objective:
Isolate the cause of the fault and repair it. To prevent packet drops while maintenance is underway, remove the interface from the bundle.

Troubleshooting Guidelines:
1) Check to see if there is any active maintenance in progress.

Any active maintenance on the chassis maybe a factor in causing this issue. If you find that there is maintenance on the chassis, then follow up with the relevant team driving the maintenance. It maybe possible that the syslog messages are a result of a card reload, or unrelated maintenance event.

If you find that there is no maintenance on the chassis, then you will need to use the following steps to investigate the problem and open a Cisco TAC case.

2) Identify the source of the problem (specific linecard location information) from the syslog message. You should be able to find this after the Interface keyword in the given syslog. In this example it is interface Hu0 0 0 6. 

3) If the interface is a member of a bundle, remove the interface from the bundle (identified in a different syslog message as Bundle-Ether4 :

config

4) Check the overall system health. For details on how the output of the commands in this TSG are used, refer to the Health Check Playbook.

To identify the faulty hardware from the following commands:

show platform
admin show platform

Fabric or linecards that are healthy will have an SW State of OPERATIONAL, and a Config State of NSHUT, as shown below:

0 0 NC55-36X100G OPERATIONAL OPERATIONAL NSHUT

If any fabric cards (shown as FCx x) are down, there is a more serious issue. Drain traffic from the chassis using the <insert drain traffic link> process, and skip to step 10.

5) Check the system for active alarms:

show alarms brief system active 

Any alarms not related to this specific linecard indicate a larger issue. Drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link> and proceed to step 6.

4) Check the fabric plane health:

admin show controller fabric plane all detail

Healthy fabric plans with be displayed in the UP state; fabric planes in the MCAST_DOWN, or DOWN state indicate a problem. The system can operate with only one operational (UP UP) fabric plane, however it will be traffic impacting. If more than one fabric plane has an issue, drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 6. If any of the fabric planes are in the MCAST_DOWN state, monitor them for 15 minutes. If they remain in that state, drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 10.

5) Check the interface optics using the following command:

show controllers optics 0 0 0 6
 Controller State: Up 
 Transport Admin State: In Service 
 Laser State: On 
 LED State: Green 
 Optics Status 
 Optics Type: QSFP28 100G AOC

A healthy interface optic will appear as shown above.

6) Check the interface controller status with the following:

show controllers hundredGigE 0 0 0 6 all

State:
 Administrative state: enabled
 Operational state: Up
 LED state: Green On

A healthy controller will appear as shown above.

7) Check the remote end of the conntection for errors.

8) If no errors are seen on the remote end of the connection, replace the cable with a known good cable.

9) If the issue persists, replace the optic.

10) Collect the following inforformation:

"Objective: Determine the location of the system component. Check to see if maintenance was or is being performed on the affected chassis linecard. Isolate the linecard, identified in the syslog message, and open up Cisco TAC case if the issue occurred without any trigger. Troubleshooting Guidelines: 1) Check to see if there is any active maintenance in progress. Any active maintenance on the chassis maybe a factor in causing this issue. If you find that there is maintenance on the chassis, then follow up with the relevant team driving the maintenance. It is possible that the syslog messages are a result of a card reload, or an unrelated maintenace event. If you find that there is no maintenance on the chassis, then you will need to use the following steps to investigate the problem and open a Cisco TAC case. 2) Identify the source of the problem (specific linecard location information) from the syslog message. You should be able to find this after the failed in keyword in the given syslog. In this example it is linecard 0 3. For details on how the output of the commands in this TSG are used, refer to the Health Check Playbook. To identify the faulty hardware from the following commands: show platform admin show platform Linecards that are healthy will have an SW State of OPERATIONAL, and a Config State of NSHUT, as shown below: 0 3 NC55-36X100G OPERATIONAL OPERATIONAL NSHUT If any fabric cards (shown as FCx x) are down, drain traffic from the system using the , and proceed to step 8. 3) Check the system for active alarms: show alarms brief system active Any alarms not related to this specific linecard indicate a larger issue; drain traffic from the system using the , and proceed to step 8. 4) How many linecards are down? If more than XX cards are down, drain traffic from the system using the , and proceed to step 8. 5) Check the fabric plane health: admin show controller fabric plane all detail Plane Admin Plane up->dn up->mcast Id State State counter counter -------------------------------------- 0 UP UP 0 0 1 UP UP 0 0 2 UP UP 0 0 3 UP UP 0 0 4 UP UP 0 0 5 UP UP 0 0 Healthy fabric plans with be displayed in the UP state; fabric planes in the MCAST_DOWN, or DOWN state indicate a problem. The system can operate with only one operational (UP UP) fabric plane, however it will be traffic impacting. If more than one fabric plane has an issue, drain traffic from the system using the , and proceed to step 8. If any of the fabric planes are in the MCAST_DOWN state, monitor them for 15 minutes, if they remain in that state, drain traffic from the system using the , and proceed to step 8. 6) Repeat step 2 to determine if the affected card is still down. If so, check the restart reason from the reboot-history command. If the card has repeatedly reset for the same reason, skip to step 8 admin show reboot-history card location 0 3 7) If the card is still down, reload the affected card, from admin mode, using this following command: hw-module location 0 3 reload Wait for the card to come up. This could take a few minutes. Repeat step 2 to verify the card status. 8) If the card is still not online then collect the following command outputs, related syslog messages and other related outputs: show logging admin show logging admin show platform admin show install active admin show reboot-history card location 0 3 show tech-support show context location all show redundancy show cli history detail show config commit list 100 show process blocked location all ( 3 times) show running admin show running admin show inventory admin show version 9) Shutdown the card by running the following command from admin mode: hw-module location 0 3 shutdown 10) Open up Cisco TAC Case.","Trigger: The Sysadmin VM has failed due to a missed heartbeat.

There are two types of parity errors.1.A soft parity error is something that can never be avoided. It is a transient event that can happen just because there is a bit that flips from 0 to 1. These soft parity errors are single events, and nothing should be done in this case. It recommend monitoring the device s behaviour for the next couple days. If the message doesn t appear again, then it s most probably that a soft parity error has occurred, which is a transient issue. 2.A hard parity error originates from a defect in the hardware. These parity errors will occur regularly and typically at an increasing frequency. In case of a hard parity error a HW replacement is needed for the module.The most common causes of soft parity errors are Static electricity due to hardware maintenance performed without proper electrostatic protection or without enough care (damage on the board), non-fully populated chassis (left with empty slots instead of slot covers), and intense electrostatic field present close to the device",The error seen indicates that a parity error was seen on the Mistral ASIC but was cleared by a reset of that ASIC.,N,SYSTEM_CONTROLLER-3-MISTRAL_RESET,SYSTEM_CONTROLLER-3-MISTRAL_RESET,*SYSTEM_CONTROLLER-3-MISTRAL_RESET*,3,0,0

These error logs indicate there is a parity error in the DRAM used by the supervisor engine. Typically these errors are transient and clear on their own, however when they repeatedly print, it s indicative of a stuck error in the memory. In this case, we can see that the error is repeatedly printing and the memory is unable to clear it during runtime. It is recommended to reset the supervisor in this switch. This will require a reload of the chassis as there is only one supervisor engine present. After the reload, monitor for any additional memory errors for 48 hours. If none appear, no further action is required.

The problem is that information s from deleted interface remains in snmp, and during subsequent MIB walks, the above error message is displayed. 
There are also possible workarounds: 

- reconfigure the deleted interface, and in interface configuration mode, do snmp ifindex clear -

- Exclude the oid mplsInterfaceConfTable from the MIB walk with snmp-server view default mplsInterfaceConfTable excluded 

 Ex. snmp-server view cw2000 mplsInterfaceConfTable excluded

- stop polling for MPLS MIB 

- reload if message keep flooding and none of workarounds above helps or can be used

Added a static route on the device to reach the Tunnel destination across the physical interface and not the Tunnel interface.,"

The generic routing encapsulation (GRE) tunnel device has discovered a recursive routing problem. This condition is usually due to one of these causes:

1)A misconfiguration that causes the device to try to route to the tunnel destination address using the tunnel interface itself (recursive routing)

2)A temporary instability caused by route flapping elsewhere in the network

Tunnel interface status depends on the IP reachability to the tunnel destination. When the device detects a recursive routing failure for the tunnel destination, it shuts the tunnel interface down for a few minutes so that the situation causing the problem can resolve itself as routing protocols converge. If the problem is caused by misconfiguration, the link can oscillate indefinitely.

Another symptom of this problem is continuously flapping Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP), Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), or Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) neighbors, when the neighbors are over a GRE tunnel.

"First, go to Cisco Unified CM Administration to check the configuration of the devices that are part of the Media Resource Groups in the Media Resource Group List that was specified in the alarm (Media Resource Group List Configuration window and Media Resource Group Configuration window in Unified CM Administration). Check whether the requested type of device is configured in any of the Media Resource Groups in that particular Media Resource Group List; for RSVP Agent, check whether any media termination point or transcoder is configured in any of the Media Resource Groups in that particular Media Resource Group List. Next, go to the Media Resources menu in Cisco Unified CM Administration to see all the devices of the requested type and then check all the Media Resource Groups (irrespective of whether they belong to the Media Resource Group List for which the alarm is generated) to determine whether the devices belong to at least one Media Resource Group. If there exists some media resources of the requested type which do not belong to any Media Resource Groups, then these devices will belong to the Default List. If the requested type of device is not configured in any of the Media Resource Groups of the Media Resource Group List for which the alarm is generated or in the Default List, add the requested type of device to a Media Resource Group in the specified Media Resource Group List or add it to the Default List. To add a media resource to the Default List, remove the Media Device from all the Media Resource Groups. In general, when a new media device is initially added to Unified CM it will automatically be added to the Default List. This Default List can be used by any device or trunk. But when the media device is added to any particular Media Resource Group it will not be available to the Default List. It can only be used by devices and trunks that are configured with the Media Resource Group List that have that particular Media Resource Group. Note that a particular Media Resource Group can be added to multiple Media Resource Group Lists. If the requested device is properly configured in Cisco Unified CM Administration, check whether the device is registered to Unified CM. To do that go to the Media Resources menu of the requested type of device (such as Annunciator or Conference Bridge or Media Termination Point or Music On Hold Server or Transcoder) and click the Find button. All the devices of that type will display along with their status, device pool, and so on. Check the status field to see whether the device is registered with Unified CM. Note that the display on the status field is not a confirmation that the device is registered to Unified CM. It may happen in a Unified CM cluster that the Publisher can only write to the Unified CM database and suppose the Publisher goes down. Because the Subscriber may not be able to write to the database the devices may still display as registered in Unified CM Administration after they are actually unregistered. However, if the Publisher is down that should generate another alarm with higher priority than this alarm. If the device is not registered, click on the name of that particular device and check the type of the device. Device types including Cisco Conference Bridge Software, Cisco Media Termination Point Software, or that specify a server name that is the same name as a Unified CM node of the cluster indicate that the requested device is a software device and is part of the Cisco IP Voice Media Streaming application. Check to be sure that the IP Voice Media Streaming App service is enabled on that Unified CM node (Cisco Unified Serviceability > Tools > Service Activation) and if it is not enabled, activate the Cisco IP Voice Media Streaming App service. Devices should try to register. You can also check the status of the service to be sure it is showing as Started (Tools > Control Center > Feature Services). If the device type is a type other than Cisco Conference Bridge Software, Cisco Media Termination Point Software, or a server name that is the same name as a Unified CM node, that indicates that the device is an external media resource to Unified CM. Check the configuration (such as Conference Bridge type, MAC address, and conference bridge name in the case of a conference bridge; Media Termination Point name in the case of a Media Termination Point; Transcoder type, MAC address, and Transcoder name in the case of a Transcoder) of the device in Cisco Unified CM Administration and compare it with the configuration of the actual device. To check the configuration of the actual device you may need to refer to the user manual of the media device. The user manual should provide all the details such as connecting to the media device to check the configuration, commands needed to view and update the configuration, and so on. If configuration in Unified CM and on the actual devices are different, make the necessary changes so that the configurations match. If the configuration matches and the device is still not registered, restart the external media device or the service associated with the external media device. If the external media device continues to fail to register with Unified CM, check the network connectivity between Unified CM and the media device","The requested device is not configured in the Media Resource Group List or Default List, or it s possible that one or more of the devices that are configured in the Media Resource Group List or Default List are not registered to Cisco Unified Communications Manager

"If all the resources of the MOH servers are already in use, check to be sure that all the MOH servers that belong to the Media Resource Groups of the indicated Media Resource Group List and Default List are configured and registered in all the applicable Unified CM nodes. To check the registration status go to the Media Resources > Music On Hold Server menu and click the Find button. It will display all the MOH servers with their status, device pool, and so on. Check the status field to discover whether it is registered with Unified CM. Note that the display on the status field is not a confirmation that the device is registered to Unified CM. It may happen in a Unified CM cluster that the Publisher can only write to the Unified CM database and the Publisher goes down. Because the Subscriber may not be able to write to the database, the devices may still display as registered in Unified CM Administration after they are actually unregistered. However, if the Publisher is down that should generate another alarm with higher priority than this alarm. The MOH allocation can also fail due to codec mismatch or capability mismatch between the endpoint and the MOH server. If there is a codec mismatch or capability mismatch (such as the endpoint using IPv6 addressing but MOH server supporting only IPv4), an MTP or transcoder should be allocated. If the MTP or transcoder is not allocated, either MediaResourceListExhausted (with Media Resource Type as media termination point or transcoder) or MtpNoMoreResourcesAvailable alarm will be generated for the same Media Resource Group List and you should first concentrate on that alarm. The MOH allocation may even fail after checking the region bandwidth between the regions to which the held party belongs and the region to which the MOH server belongs. Increasing the region bandwidth may be a solution to the problem, but that decision should be made after careful consideration of the amount of bandwidth you re willing to allocate per call between the set of regions. You ll need to weigh different factors such as the total amount of available bandwidth, the average number of calls, the average number of calls using the MOH servers, approximate bandwidth use per call, and so on, and accordingly calculate the region bandwidth. Another possible cause is that the bandwidth needed for the call may not be available. This can occur if the MOH server and endpoint belong to different locations and the bandwidth that is set between the locations is already in use by other calls. Examine the bandwidth requirements in your deployment to determine whether bandwidth between the locations can be increased. However, please note that increasing the bandwidth between these two locations means that you may need to reduce the bandwidth between other locations. Refer to the System Guide, SRNDs, and related Unified CM documentation for more details. Be aware that reducing the bandwidth or removing the higher bandwidth codecs from configuration may result in poor voice quality during call. Consider increasing the total amount of network bandwidth. Another reason for the MOH allocation failure may be due to meeting the maximum number of unicast or multicast streams supported by the MOH server. If all available streams are already in use, none can be allocated. Finally, check the Music On Hold Audio Source Configuration window in Cisco Unified CM Administration to confirm that at least one audio source is configured. If an audio source is not configured, upload an audio file and then configure the audio source in Cisco Unified CM Administration (refer to the Music On Hold configuration documentation for specific details)",This alarm occurs when allocation of Music on Hold fails for all the registered MOH (Music on hold) servers belonging to the Media Resource Group List and Default List. Each MOH server may fail for different reasons. Following are some of the reasons that could cause an MOH server allocation to fail: All the resources of MOH server are already in use; No matching codecs or capability mismatch between the held party and the MOH server; not enough bandwidth between the held party and MOH source; No audio stream available from the MOH server.,N,UC_CALLMANAGER-4-MohNoMoreResourcesAvailable,UC_CALLMANAGER-4-MohNoMoreResourcesAvailable,*UC_CALLMANAGER-4-MohNoMoreResourcesAvailable*,4,0,0
"If the MTP or transcoder allocation is failing due to a capability mismatch, it s possible that the media device does not support the capability (such as IPv4 to IPv6 conversion, passthrough) or the capability might not be configured in the device. Please check the user guide and documentation of the media device to make sure that device supports all the necessary capabilities. Also, caution should be taken if all the MTP or transcoders are configured with all the supported capabilities. There are certain capabilities (such as RFC 2833 DTMF or RFC 2833 DTMF passthrough or passthrough) which could be supported by most of the MTPs or transcoders and there may be certain capabilities (such as IPv4 to IPv6 conversion and vice versa or Transfer Relay Point or multimedia capability) which can be supported by only by a single MTP or transcoder depending on the devices that you have. For example, you may have IP phones that support only IPv4 protocol and there may also be IP phones that support only IPv6 protocol. To make a call between IPv4-only and IPv6-only phones, you need to have an MTP configured to perform the conversion of IPv4 to IPv6 and vice versa. However, suppose all the MTPs or transcoders are configured with all the supported capabilities and only one MTP supports IPv4 to IPv6 conversion; if this MTP is configured with all the supported capabilities (which all the other MTPs or transcoders in the same MRGL or default MRGL also support) it may happen that this MTP can get allocated for Transfer Relay Point or RFC 2833 DTMF or RFC 2833 DTMF passthrough or passthrough instead. As a result, when the need arises for IPv4 to IPv6 conversion (which other MTPs or transcoders in the same MRGL or default MRGL do not support), all the resources of MTP may be in use and the IPv4 to IPv6 conversion may fail. To avoid this kind of problem, setting the priority of the media resources may be a good idea. This can be done only in the Media Resource Group List and not in the Default List of the media resources. In any Media Resource Group List all the Media Resource Groups have different priorities; during allocation the first Media Resource Group is always checked for availability of the requested type of the media devices. The first Media Resource Group in the Media Resource Group List will have the highest priority, then the second one, and so on. To check all the Media Resource Groups and their priority go the Media Resources and Media Resource Group List of Cisco Unified CM Administration page and click the appropriate Media Resource Group List and check the Selected Media Resource Groups; the priority decreases from top to bottom. So, the MTP or transcoder that you want to be selected for the most basic functionalities should be positioned in the higher priority Media Resource Groups whereas the ones with more rare functionality should be positioned in the Media Resource Groups with lower priority. MTP transcoder allocation may fail due to codec mismatch between the endpoint and the MTP transcoder. A solution may be to configure the MTP transcoder with all the supported codecs (as specified in the user guide of the MTP transcoder), but be aware that doing so might result in too much bandwidth being allocated for calls. You ll need to weigh different factors such as the total amount of available bandwidth, the average number of calls, approximate bandwidth use per call (not involving MTP transcoder), and so on, and accordingly calculate the maximum bandwidth that can be allocated per call involving an MTP transcoder and take that into consideration when configuring the supported codecs in the MTPs and transcoders. It s a good idea to configure the media devices with all the supported codecs and set the region bandwidths to restrict too much bandwidth usage (refer to the Unified CM documentation for details on region and location settings). Also, there may be a codec mismatch between the endpoint and the MTP transcoders after considering the region bandwidth between the MTP transcoder and the endpoint. Increasing the region bandwidth may be a solution to the problem, but again, that decision should be made after careful consideration of the amount of bandwidth you re willing to allocate per call between the set of regions. Another possible cause that an MTP transcoder did not get allocated is because there was not enough available bandwidth for the call. This can happen if the MTP transcoder and endpoint belong to different locations and the bandwidth that is set between the locations is already in use by other calls. Examine the bandwidth requirements in your deployment to determine whether bandwidth between the locations can be increased. However, please note that increasing the bandwidth between these two locations means that you may need to reduce the bandwidth between other locations. Refer to the System Guide, SRNDs, and related Unified CM documentation for more details. Be aware that reducing the bandwidth or removing the higher bandwidth codecs from configuration may result in poor voice quality during call. Consider increasing the total amount of network bandwidth available. Finally, if MTP or transcoder allocation fails due to capability mismatch or all the resources being in use, consider installing additional MTP or transcoder devices","The alarm occurs when allocation of a media termination point (MTP) or transcoder fails for all the registered MTPs or transcoders belonging to the Media Resource Group List and Default List. Each MTP or transcoder may fail for different reasons. Following are some of the reasons that could cause an MTP or transcoder allocation to fail: a capability mismatch between the device endpoint and MTP transcoder, codec mismatch between the endpoint and the MTP transcoder; a lack of available bandwidth between the endpoint and the MTP transcoder; or because the MTP transcoders resources are already in use. A capability mismatch may be due to the MTP transcoder not supporting one or more of the required capabilities for the call such as Transfer Relay Point (which is needed for QoS or firewall traversal), RFC 2833 DTMF (which is necessary when one side of the call does not support RFC 2833 format for transmitting DTMF digits and the other side must receive the DTMF digits in RFC 2833 format, resulting in conversion of the DTMF digits), RFC 2833 DTMF passthrough (in this case, the MTP or transcoder does not need to convert the DTMF digits from one format to another format but it needs to receive DTMF digits from one endpoint and transmit them to the other endpoint without performing any modifications), passthrough (where no codec conversion will occur, meaning the media device will receive media streams in any codec format and transmit them to the other side without performing any codec conversion), IPv4 to IPv6 conversion (when one side of the call supports only IPv4 and the other side of the call supports only IPv6 and so an MTP needs to be inserted to perform the necessary conversion between IPv4 and IPv6 packets), or multimedia capability (if a call involving video and or data in addition to audio requires insertion of an MTP or transcoder then the MTP transcoder which supports multimedia will be inserted).

"'These are the common errors from the Mistral ASIC on the MSFC. Possible causes of these parity errors are random static discharge or other external factors. Processor Memory Parity Errors (PMPEs) are are broken down into two types: single event upset (SEU) and repeated errors.
These single bit errors occur when a bit in a data word changes unexpectedly due to external events (which causes, for example, a zero to spontaneously change to a one). SEUs are a universal phenomenon irrespective of vendor or technology. SEUs occur very infrequently, but all network devices are subject to them. SEUs are also called soft errors, which are caused by noise and result in a transient, inconsistent error in the data, this is unrelated to a component failure - most often the result of cosmic radiation.
Repeated errors (often referred to a hard errors) are caused by failed components. A hard error is caused by a failed component or a board-level problem, such as an improperly manufactured printed circuit board that results in repeated occurrences of the same error.

SEUs are a universal phenomenon irrespective of vendor or technology. SEUs occur very infrequently, but all network devices are subject to them. SEUs are also called soft errors, which are caused by noise and result in a transient, inconsistent error in the data, this is unrelated to a component failure - most often the result of cosmic radiation.

"Determine if maintenance is currently underway, if not, collect CLI information and open a TAC case.

1) Check to see if there is any active maintenance in progress.

Any active maintenance on the chassis maybe a factor in causing this issue. If you find that there is maintenance on the chassis, then follow up with the relevant team driving the maintenance. It maybe possible that the syslog messages are a result of an active maintenance window. 

If you find that there is no maintenance on the chassis, then you will need to use the following steps to investigate the problem and open a Cisco TAC case.

2) Identify the source of the problem (specific fabric card location information) from card number after the DOWN at keyword in the syslog message. For example: 0 FC5. For details on how the output of the commands in this TSG are used, refer to the Health Check Playbook.

To identify the faulty hardware from the following commands:

show platform
admin show platform

Linecards that are healthy will have an SW State of OPERATIONAL, and a Config State of NSHUT, as shown below:

0 FC4 NC55-5516-FC OPERATIONAL OPERATIONAL NSHUT 

Healthy fabric cards should by in the HW SW OPERATIONAL, and Config NSHUT states.

3) Check the system for active alarms:

show alarms brief system active 

Any alarms not related to this specific linecard indicate a larger issue. Drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 7.

4) How many fabric cards are down? If more than one card is down, drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 7.

5) Check the fabric plane health:

Plane Admin Plane up->dn up->mcast
Id State State counter counter
--------------------------------------
0 UP UP 0 0
1 UP UP 0 0
2 UP UP 0 0
3 UP UP 0 0
4 UP UP 0 0
5 UP UP 0 0

Healthy fabric plans with be displayed in the UP state; fabric planes in the MCAST_DOWN, or DOWN state indicate a problem. The system can operate with only one operational (UP UP) fabric plane, however it will be traffic impacting. If more than one fabric plane has an issue, drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 7. If any of the fabric planes are in the MCAST_DOWN state, monitor them for 15 minutes. If they remain in that state, drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 7.

admin show controller fabric plane all detail 
admin show controller fabric health

6) Reload the affected fabric card from admin mode:

hw-module location 0 FC4 reload

Wait for the card to come up; this may take a few minutes. repeat step 2 to verify the card has successfully rebooted.

7) If the problem still exists then collect following CLI command output, and related syslog messages:

show logging
admin show logging
admin show platform
admin show install active
show tech-support
show context location all
show redundancy
show cli history detail
show config commit list 100

1- Please start out by inspecting the active RSP console logs and determine if there is repeated process crashes or any PFM errors reported from the node or if there is any timeout errors declared by the shelfmgr against the node. 
2- If no such indication is seen in the RSP logs, then the next step is to inspect the affected node’s console output itself to see if there is any errors leading to node resets are reported on it. 
3- If the above actions identify the root cause, please note it, collect the following information and provide this data to your Cisco technical representative. 
4- Data to collect: - The full console output of both RSPs and the node console output if available. - The attachCon output for the IN_RESET node, when it was rebooted in step 3. - #show logging - #show tech-support shelfmgr - #show reboot history location affected location - #show pfm location affected location - #show reboot pcds location affected location 
5- If the root cause was not identified in above steps, the next step is to reboot the node IN_RESET and see if an error that identifies the root cause occurs and if the node can recover from the problem. It is important to have the LC console data connected at this point. If this is not feasible, then please issue the ’attachCon affected location’ from the RSP Aux terminal immediately after rebooting the node: - #hw-module location affected location from the RSP console - #attachCon affected location from the RSP Aux terminal 
6- Please contact your Cisco technical representative and provide the collected information to them.
